Additionally, we utilize machine learning to reward coin miners/minters that use green energy to incentivise a move towards a cleaner, more sustainable blockchain. ‚ôªÔ∏è Built Different || EcoBlock uses a Proof of Stake system (POS) built using Typescript for coin distribution compared to the common Proof of Work system (POW). POS rewards users for how many coins they hold (stake) while POW rewards users based on their computing power to solve math problems. The move from computing intensive generation to a much more energy efficient 'lottery' esque generation accounts for the majority of energy savings that EcoBlock can do. üçÄ Reward the Good || What differentiates us from other existing POS currencies is that we reward miners/minter for using certified green energy sources through our EcoBoost system. We use Google Cloud Vision to scan energy bills to determine is a mining/minting operation uses certified clean energy to run their computers. If so, we reward them by increasing their adding a multiplier onto their balance when deciding who wins a newly minted block. Combined these two approaches create one of the greenest and most sustainable approaches to cryptocurrency possible. üöÄ Ready for Takeoff || EcoBlock isn't only a simple blockchain. We were able to implement many features needed to introduce EcoBlock to the real world such as creating an IOS and Android wallet for storing, monitoring, transfering, and minting coins. Additionally we ensure that our system is secure as we prevent tampering by checking blocks and not adding any tampered blocks to the blockchain. A malicious user would need to own over 51% of the entire currency to tamper with the blockchain which is extremely unrealistic in practice. Key Working Features: Proof of Stake Blockchain with P2P connection and automatic host finding, OCR with Google Cloud Vision through REST API, Flutter frontend connected to Firebase and Blockchain, working private and public keys with wallets, functional transactions between blockchain nodes, python CLI for the blockchain.",

Not only did we learn flask, some more python, web hosting, NFC interactions, blockchain and more, we were also able to combine these ideas into one cohesive project. Being able to see the blockchain run for the first time after hours of troubleshooting was a magical moment for all of us. As for the smaller wins sprinkled through the day we were able to work with physical NFC tags and create labels that we stuck on just about any product we had. We also came out more confident in the skills we already knew and also developed new skills we gained on the way."

We came into the hackathon with only a rudimentary idea what blockchains even were and throughout the development process we came to understand the nuances of blockchain technology and security. As for web development and hosting using the flask framework to create pages that were populated with python objects was certainly a learning curve for us but it was a learning curve that we overcame. Lastly, we were all able to learn more about each other and also the difficulties and joys of pursuing a project that seemed almost impossible at the start."

As a clinic, you can go into the Vaccurate clinic portal and register with us. Once registered we are able to send you a list of individuals our program deems to be the most at risk so that all doses received can be distributed effectively. Under the hood, we process your data using weights we got based off of government distribution plans and automatically plan out the distribution and also contact the users for the clinics!",
